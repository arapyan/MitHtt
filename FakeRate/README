-ComputeElectronFakeRate_Data.C & ComputeMuonFakeRate_Data.C computes the electron and muon fake rates respectively as a function of
    pt and eta, and produce root files with graphs.

-predictFakesMuEle.C reads the fake rates from these root files and applies them to
    a mueg (Bacon) ntuple(s), and writes an ntuple that can be read by plotEmu.C. Just move
    this ntuple to the selection directory along with the selections from selectEmu.C
    Input files and json are listed at the top of predictFakseMuEle.C
