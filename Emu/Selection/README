Instructions for running on Bacon:

selectEmu.C reads the (bacon) ntuples and does lepton, jet id and computes variables. It then writes another ntuple (in my case to /build/vdutta/htt/selections/<selection-name>/ntuples) to be read by the plotting macro plotEmu.C, which also does some selection and produces yield tables, plots, an html page with links to all the plots, and a file with input histograms for calculating limits.


Steps:

1) Adjust emu.conf to reflect the ntuples which you've made and want to run over and your json location.
2) change command-line arguments in run.sh to reflect what you want to happen. Probably just run selectEmu.C by itself to start with.
3) ./run.sh
4) change run.sh to run plotEmu.C with the arguments you want.
5) ./run.sh


Same-sign fakes:

Run on data only, with the name 'data' changed to 'ss-fakes' in emu.conf.
