Instructions for running on Bacon:

selectEmu.C reads the ("bacon") ntuples and does lepton, jet id and computes variables. It then writes flat ntuples ("bacon bits", if you like :-)) to be read by the plotting macro plotEmu.C, which also does some selection and produces yield tables, plots, an html page with links to all the plots, and a file with input histograms for calculating limits.


Steps:

1) Adjust emu.conf to reflect the ntuples which you've made and want to run over and your json location.
2) change command-line arguments in run.sh to reflect what you want to happen. You could start by running selectEmu.C ... be aware, this takes a while if you're running over the full sample list!
3) ./run.sh
4) change run.sh to run plotEmu.C with the arguments you want.
5) ./run.sh


Same-sign fakes:

These come from data, with the name 'data' changed to 'ss-fakes' in emu.conf (already set up to work).


Fake-rate fakes:

These are estimated separately, see MitHtt/FakeRate.
