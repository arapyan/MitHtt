Instructions for running on Ntuples:

selectEmu.C reads the ntuples and does lepton, jet id and computes variables. Since this takes
about five minutes, it then writes another ntuple (in my case to
/home/vdutta/htt/selections/<selection-name>/ntuples) to be read by the plotting macro
plotEmu.C, which also does some selection.


Steps:

1) Adjust emu.conf to reflect the ntuples which you've made and want to run over and
your json location. If you like syntax highlighting, don't use the ancient emacs that
ships with SL5.
2) change command-line arguments in run.sh to reflect what you want to happen. Probably
just run selectEmu.C by itself to start with.
3) ./run.sh
4) change run.sh to run plotEmu.C with the arguments you want.
5) ./run.sh


Same-sign fakes:

Run on data only, with the name 'data' changed to 'ss-fakes' in emu.conf, and change
the == to != for the charges.
