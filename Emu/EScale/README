-see run.sh
-selectee and plotee work just the same as in emu -- except all plotee does that we care about
      is output a flat ntuple with the variables we need to do the energy scale.

-fit.conf configures the actual fit for the mass, which is done by escalefit.C
  -format: input ntuple
           %
           output dir
	   %
	   etabins      deltaeta        etamin

-run escalefit.C on data and zee MC
-this creates root files in the specified directory with the MC and data scales
    and resolutions.
-EScale.hh reads these root files (you have to tell it which directory to get them from) and
     applies the corrections with the pt(Double_t eta) function;
-testCorrection.C reads the flat ntuples and corrections from the directory you give, and
     applies the corrections to the MC, and writes some plots
