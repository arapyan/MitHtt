-see run.sh

-selectEleFO.C selects fakeable objects from a double electron ntuple and writes them
   to a flat ntuple in the specified directory (see data_smu.fo)

-computeFakeRate.C reads this flat ntuple and computes the fake rate as a function of
    pt and eta, and makes plots and and a root file with graphs in the output directory.
    Configured with elefr.input, with format:
          output dir
	  %
	  output root file
	  %
	  ...
	  binnings
	  ...

-predictFakesMuEle.C reads the fake rates from this root file and applies them to
    a mueg ntuple, and writes an ntuple that can be read by plotEmu.C, so I move
    this ntuple to the selection directory along with the selections from selectEmu.C
    Input files and json are just listed at the top of predictFakseMuEle.C
