Instructions for producing FlatNtuples:

run.sh takes the datasets in htt.conf and produces ntuples for each channel.
Look for example in selecEmu.C to see how htt.conf should be formated. 

One needs MitHtt/Ntupler (bacon), MitHtt/Utils, MitHtt/data, MitHtt/Common and MitHtt/FlatNtupler packages.

It's a good idea to check the selection for a channel of interest to see the different types of options that can be applied.

On going work:

1) Create a flag for 2011/2012 differences in trigger, efficiencies, cuts, etc.
2) selectEmu---add 2011 trigger, add vbf MVA
3) selectTauTau  ---- trigger efficiencies
4) selecMuTau    ---- triggers, trigger scale efficiencies, vbf mva 
5) select ETau   ---- triggers, trigger scale efficiencies, vbf mva
