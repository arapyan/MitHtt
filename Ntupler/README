Instructions for running Ntupler:

It takes the datasets in htt.config and produces "Bacon" ntuples for each one. The only event selection is a trigger requirement in data. The object selections
are very, very loose.

Steps to run:

1)  export MIT_VERS=025 (or whatever); cd ~/cms/cmssw/$MIT_VERS/CMSSW_X_X_X/src;
2)  compile Ntupler
3)  test runHttNtupler.C in macros directory
4)  cd condor
5)  choose datasets to comment in htt.config
6)  ./process.sh
7)  wait for jobs to finish
8)  ./runmerge.sh
9)  ./runskim.sh

Explanation:

6) reads lines from htt.config, then calls submitjobs.sh for each dataset. This then calls runjob.sh on each fileset. Specify output dir in process.sh

8) merges output root/json files.

9) skims merged ntuples. Modify macros/SkimNtuples.C to change skimming.
