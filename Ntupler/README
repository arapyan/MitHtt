Instructions for running Ntupler:

It takes the datasets in hypha.config and outputs ntuples for each one in, in my case,
/scratch/dkralph/htt. The only event selection is a trigger requirement in data (although
I try to add all triggers, so this isn't really a requirement). The object selections
are very, very loose.

Steps to run:

1)  compile Ntupler
1b) test runmacro, of course (probably runhypha.C)
2)  cd condor
2b) choose datasets to comment in hypha.config
3)  ./process.sh
4)  wait for jobs to finish
5)  ./checkResults.sh <condor-results-dir>
6)  ./checkRootFiles.sh
7)  ./runMerge.sh
8)  ./clean.sh

Explanation:

3) reads lines from hypha.config, then calls submitjobs.sh for each dataset. This then calls runjob.sh
on each fileset. Specify output dir in process.sh

5) greps for many errors in the condor output files.

6) checks that all files are present. Not as useful as it was in CP's framework, since now if a job crashes halfway
through you still get half an output file, rather than none.

7) specify output dir here. If a job failed halfway through this will complain, but charge on regardless,
so if you ignored the errors in (5) you will again be warned here.

8) specify output dir here.
